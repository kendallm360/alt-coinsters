# Alt-Coinsters

For my showcase project I decided to make an app for people who are interested in/ would like to learn about alt-coins. Site users can gain initial exposure to the space by learning a few of the basics, see market data for some of my favorite alt-coins, and add coins to a watchlist. Guidelines for this project can be found [here](https://frontend.turing.edu/projects/module-3/showcase.html).

## Goals

Use the technology youâ€™ve been working with over the course of the module to demonstrate mastery of the following:
- React
- Router
- Asynchronous JavaScript
- End to end testing with Cypress
- Create personas and user stories to describe your target audience.
- Display the data from the API in a way that applies directly to your audience
- Ability for users to store/manipulate the data displayed in the application, such as favoriting or adding to a list, searching, commenting, etc
- Multiple views handled by Router
- Be deployed using Heroku, Surge, or any other similar service

## Technologies Used

- React
- React Router
- Chart.js
- Javascript
- CSS
- Cypress.io
- Postman

## Challenges

- Working around API fetch limits
- Getting sick during the last couple of days
- Charting financial data and other data that has many points and need to plotted linearally

## Wins

- Writing my first app using hooks from the start
- Successfully implementing the utils file and Chart.js
